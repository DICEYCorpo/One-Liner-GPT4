Eda,Human Resources Information System Analyst,HackerOne,National University,,,"It has been more than a decade since I co-founded HackerOne. Early adopters were all tech companies and digital natives like Instacart ü•ï, Shopify üõçÔ∏è, and Salesforce üí∞. Ten years later, we serve many complex organizations I couldn't even imagine back then, like UK Ministry of Defence ü™ñ, United States Air Force ‚úàÔ∏è, Starbucks ‚òï, or John Deere üöú. Throughout these ten years, I've seen many different incarnations of bug bounty programs - some big, some small, some public, and many private. Not one of these is the same. What all of them have in common is a hidden yet powerful security feedback loop. When I started digging into how some of our best customers were taking advantage of this feedback loop, I quickly realized not all of our clients knew how or were staffed to take advantage of it. That inspired our latest offering: HackerOne Security Advisory Services (SAS), built to optimize value and maximize ROI for our customers. I'll explain in this blog how we help our customers strengthen their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by activating the feedback loop present in every bug bounty program. https://lnkd.in/gaTUAnr4"

Because it needs to be done BEFORE customers are acquired. If you can't deliver what the customer wants, you've spent money to close customers who will churn as soon as they find out. The CSM's mission is to deliver what the customer came for. Customer success (the outcome) starts with setting the right expectations from the beginning. Most SaaS companies don't do it because they still believe that if they don't exclude any use case, they will grow faster. But keeping things vague and not clarifying them during the sales process will backfire. Because on top of churn, as mentioned above, they might feel that they've been deliberately misled and talk about it in public. Build a strong positioning that clearly defines what your customers get out of your product, who it is for, and who it is not.
